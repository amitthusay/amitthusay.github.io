<!-- <h2>Haptic-Enabled Switch Adapted Toys (SAT)s</h2>

In Summer 2024, I worked on integrating haptic interfaces into switch-adapted toys (SATs). Haptic interfaces can be used to characterize visual or auditory responses into normal vibrotactile feedback, like a phone’s ringer. SATs are developed specifically for children with cerebral palsy or limited motor function, so that the traditional input mechanism of a electronic toy can be adapted to a motor function, such as a muscle contraction, that is convenient for the child. The goal was to incorporate haptic feedback into this adapted input mechanism to provide additional stimulus and sensory input. By the end of the summer, I presented a prototype to the president of ReplayForKids, a nonprofit organization, and received valuable feedback on tailoring the device for educators and therapists. From Fall 2024 to Spring 2025, I mainly worked on developing a clean PCB that would work directly with the button's enclosure. For this upcoming Fall 2025, I will be coordinating with ReplayForKids to include the parts for these prototypes at their annual workshop. I will also be seeking out therapists and educators for testing these toys with children.

## Haptic-Enabled Switch Adapted Toys (SATs)

In **Summer 2024**, I integrated haptic interfaces into switch-adapted toys (SATs). Haptic interfaces translate visual or auditory responses into vibrotactile feedback (like a phone’s ringer).

SATs are designed for children with cerebral palsy or limited motor function. They replace a toy’s traditional input with one that’s more accessible—such as a muscle contraction. My goal was to add haptic feedback to that adapted input, providing additional sensory input and stimulation.

By the end of the summer, I presented a prototype to the president of **ReplayForKids**, receiving feedback on tailoring the device for educators and therapists.

From **Fall 2024** through **Spring 2025**, I focused on a clean PCB that fits the button enclosure. In **Fall 2025**, I’ll coordinate with ReplayForKids to include parts for these prototypes at their annual workshop and will seek testing feedback from therapists and educators.
